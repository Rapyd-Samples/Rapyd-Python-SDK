| network_reference_id     | `str`        | ❌       | Identifier for use in a recurring card payment.

This field cannot be used together with a payment method ID or a customer ID. Note that for all payments, you must use the network reference ID from adding the payment method to the customer. The response in each subsequent payment contains a different network reference ID, which is not for use in requests.
