# PaymentOptions

A payment method type is a type of payment method that any customer can use, for example, ee*mastercard_card, Mastercard for Estonia. When it is added to a customer profile, it becomes a payment method that is specific to that one customer. The name of the payment method type starts with a prefix for the country, the 2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code. If the payment method is valid in multiple countries, the prefix is xx*. The payment method type has a suffix with one of the following values - \_bank - Bank transfer or bank redirect \_card - Credit card, debit card or other card \_cash - Cash \_ewallet - Local eWallet
